## 🧠 Advanced Testing Concepts Implemented

### 1. **Mock-Based Educational Pattern**
```java
// Concept simulation approach
private static class BiasDetectionEngine {
    public BiasAnalysisResult analyzeGeographicBias(Map<String, StationData> stationData) {
        // Educational simulation of complex ML algorithms
        return new BiasAnalysisResult(false, Map.of("urban", 0.8, "suburban", 0.7));
    }
}
```

**Philosophy**: Teach testing patterns that work regardless of implementation complexity

### 2. **Progressive Complexity Architecture**
- **Lab 1-2**: Basic testing concepts with simple assertions
- **Lab 3-4**: Intermediate patterns with coverage analysis
- **Lab 5-6**: Advanced concepts with real-world applications

### 3. **Real-World Integration**
- **Swedish Legal Compliance**: Valid personnummer with Luhn validation
- **International Standards**: WCAG accessibility guidelines
- **Industry Practices**: DevOps, CI/CD, sustainability metrics

## 🎯 Key Educational Innovations

### 1. **Concept-First Testing**
Instead of implementing complex algorithms, the framework:
- Creates **interfaces** that show how testing should work
- Provides **validation patterns** for complex concepts
- Teaches **scalable structures** that work in production

### 2. **Layered Abstraction Strategy**
```java
// Teaching Pattern:
// Complex Concept → Simple Implementation → Sophisticated Test
private static class DataRetentionPolicy {
    // Simple rule for education
    private boolean shouldDeleteUser(User user) {
        return user.getEmail().contains("old");
    }
}

// But sophisticated test patterns:
@Test
void shouldValidateDataRetentionAndDeletionPolicies() {
    // Students learn GDPR compliance patterns
    // Test structure works for real implementations
}
```

### 3. **Production-Ready Test Structures**
All test structures are designed to:
- Work with real implementations when replaced
- Scale to enterprise complexity
- Follow industry best practices
- Maintain educational clarity
